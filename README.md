# visPublicTransport
We are exploring the possibility of communicating the associated uncertainty with any means of public transport to the commuters. This we believe may help commuters make an informed decision while using the public transport. For this purpose, we are designing a mobile app interface and plan to conduct user study in two thriving cities of the world: Melbourne and Mumbai.

This is an ongoing work.
